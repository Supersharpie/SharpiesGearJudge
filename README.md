# Sharpie's Gear Judge (Classic Era, TBC Anniversary & WoW Forever)

**The Final Verdict on your gear.**

**Sharpie's Gear Judge (SGJ)** is a real-time **theorycrafting engine** and UI enhancement for **World of Warcraft: Classic Era**, the **TBC Anniversary Edition**, and **WoW: Forever**.

Unlike addons that give items static points (e.g. "Hit = 10 pts"), SGJ understands **context**. It knows if you are hit-capped, if a helm swap will break your Meta Gem, whether a quest reward beats what you're wearing, and in TBC it can **project** the best gems and enchants for an item before you equip it.

## 🔥 What's New

> **WoW Forever players:** leveling PvP builds and weights are being worked on.

### 3.2.14

- **Hunter:** your Hit now also counts for your pet, your pet uses Bite and Claw, and hawks hit as hard as combat logs show. Bestial Discipline no longer overrates Spirit. New solo, Beast Mastery and PvP leveling talent orders.
- **Rogue:** Deadly Poison now grows with Attack Power on every tick, as combat logs show. New Assassination talent orders and small changes for Combat and Subtlety.
- **Shaman:** mana now varies from pull to pull in the models. Faster dungeon and PvP leveling talent orders, and Elemental PvP leveling is back.
- **Warlock:** mana now varies from pull to pull in the models, and the Voidwalker has more health. Faster talent orders for Demonology Drain Life solo and Affliction and Destruction PvP leveling.
- **Talents:** the build picker beside the talent window now matches the Builds page, with stage tabs, Solo, Dungeon and PvP tags, how much slower each build is, and your active build marked. The panel is on again for everyone.
- **Fixed:** scrolling the mouse wheel over the character model in the Gear Judge and Roadmap windows no longer causes an error.

### 3.2.13

- **Roadmap and Roster:** small upgrades count now, the same as on the tooltip.
- **Talents:** PvP leveling orders updated for Paladin, Warrior, Mage, Druid, Priest and Rogue.
- **Protection Paladin:** Hammer of the Righteous now counts. New leveling and dungeon tank orders and weights.
- **Warrior:** Unbridled Wrath now gives rage on Heroic Strike, each Cleave target and weapon specials. The Arms and Fury PvP leveling builds are back.

### 3.2.12

- **Feral Druid weights:** solo leveling rebuilt. Hit, Crit and Stamina count for more at levels 20-40.
- **Druid Talents:** Feral and Balance solo orders updated, and the % slower tags corrected.
- **Frost Mage weights:** solo leveling rebuilt. Crit, Hit, Intellect and Spirit count for less at levels 45-50.
- **Mage Talents:** solo and dungeon orders updated.
- **Priest weights:** solo leveling rebuilt. Mp5 and Spirit count for a little less at levels 10-35.
- **Priest Talents:** Shadow and Discipline solo orders updated, and the no-Shadowform % slower tag corrected.
- **Buffs:** rebuilt from the November 7 client. The Hyjal flasks count as 30 Stamina, not 60.

### 3.2.11

- **Profession arrows in DaylightUI:** recipes that craft an upgrade get the green arrow in DaylightUI's profession window.
- **Enhancement Shaman weights:** rebuilt for leveling. At levels 15-24 Spirit counts for a bit less, Intellect and Stamina for more. Levels 1-9 no longer jump about 6x at level 10.
- **Paladin weights:** solo leveling rebuilt with Hammer of Wrath from level 44. Retribution levels 1-9 no longer jump about 4x at level 10, and Mp5 no longer drops to 0 around level 44.
- **Shockadin:** the Paladin profile Holy: Solo Leveling is now named Shockadin: Solo Leveling.
- **Holy Paladin dungeons:** Talents order adjusted slightly at levels 15-17.

### 3.2.10

- **Loot upgrade alerts:** an item you loot or receive that's an upgrade pops up a small alert with the gain. Click it to equip.
- **Bag arrows on by default:** green and red arrows now show on bag items without turning them on (untick **Show Bag Upgrade Arrows** to hide them).
- **Quest rewards in DaylightUI:** upgrade and downgrade arrows on quest rewards in DaylightUI's NPC window.
- **Bag arrows on small upgrades:** arrows now show on every item the tooltip calls an upgrade or downgrade, small ones included.

### 3.2.9

- **November 4 hotfix (WoW Forever):** Elemental and Restoration Shaman leveling weights rebuilt for the 2-second Chain Lightning.

### 3.2.8

- **Launch weights (WoW Forever):** leveling and dungeon weights for every class follow Blizzard's launch notes, and dungeon mana is paced like a real group (short drinks between pulls, a full drink only when you run dry).
- **Weights that follow your gear:** on WoW Forever, leveling weights shift with quest-reward vs. best-for-your-level gear, and level-60 weights with pre-raid vs. Tier 1; on Classic Era, raid weights for most DPS specs follow your raid tier. `/sgj gearpoint` shows where you are.
- **Hit cap everywhere:** bag arrows and the Roster plugin value hit around your cap the same way tooltips do.
- **Profile from your talents (WoW Forever):** your profile comes from the shipped build closest to your talents, read by spell so renamed talents still count.
- **Launch class and racial changes (WoW Forever):** Hunter, Mage, Warlock and Paladin changes, and Stat Logic follows the new racials.
- **Healer gear fix:** healing, spell power and Mp5 on your gear are no longer missed right after login.

## 🚀 Key Features

### ⚔️ Built for WoW Forever

- **Level-60 weights for every class**, worked out with each build's own talents: damage and tank profiles from the wowsims Forever simulator, healer profiles from a healing model in which healers downrank as they do in game.
- **Profiles that match how you play:** Raid, Solo Leveling, Dungeon Leveling, AoE Farming and PvP, named after the builds in the Talents plugin (for example "Arms: Raid", "Holy: Dungeon Leveling").
- **Leveling weights level by level** for every Forever spec, from 10 to 59, built from the talents, spells and gear stats each spec actually has at that level. Your actual talents adjust them, and so does your gear (`/sgj gearpoint`).
- **Hit and defense targets follow your level.** While leveling that's 5% hit (4% spell hit) against same-level mobs. With **Gear for Raiding** on, the targets slide toward the raid caps (9% hit, 17% spell hit, 440 Defense, uncrushable) from level 50.
- **Gear for PvP:** Stamina, armor and burst count for more, and hit stays at the player-vs-player caps. The first time a realm looks like a PvP realm, Gear Judge offers to turn it on.
- **Relics are rated**, and new race/class combinations are supported.

### 🧠 Dynamic "Cap Guardian" Engine

The Judge watches your stats in real time and penalizes gear that would drop you below a critical threshold.

1. **Weight scalers (proactive):** hit and defense weights shrink as you approach your caps, so every item is scored with your current needs in mind.
2. **Cap Guardian (reactive):** if you're at or above a cap and a swap would drop you below it, the item gets a score penalty and a tooltip warning.

- **Tank defense:** 490 at 70 on TBC, 440 at 60 on Era, and on Forever a slide to 440 from level 50 (with Gear for Raiding on). Only applies when your profile weights defense.
- **Judged without buffs:** caps and thresholds read your gear and talents, not the food, elixirs or party buffs you happen to have on.
- **Buff Assumptions (all versions):** turn on **Assume Raid Buffed** or **Assume World Buffed** to credit the buffs you'd have in a group, raid or with world buffs.
- **Hybrid live preview:** tooltips answer *"if I swap this piece, where does my hit land?"* without you equipping it.

### 🔮 Smart Projection (SimC-Lite)

- **Gem simulator (TBC):** three strategies — **The Skeptic** (empty sockets = 0), **The Casual** (respect socket colors), **The Pro** (min-max, off-color gems included).
- **Gem quality tier (TBC):** project sockets with Common, Uncommon, Rare or Epic gems.
- **Enchant projector:** compare items as if they had the best enchant for your level and spec. Your worn item shows which enchant that is.
- **Meta gem enforcement (TBC):** detects when a swap would turn off your Meta Gem.
- **Progression-aware gem pool:** on TBC progression servers, projected gems follow the **Content Phase** set in Roadmap.

### 📊 Tooltip Verdicts

Hover any item: world drops, vendor goods, quest rewards, dungeon loot or AH listings.

- **Judge's Score** for your active spec (and any tracked off-specs).
- **Item Score:** the item's own score in its slot, and the score of what you wear there.
- **Upgrade / Downgrade verdict** with the score difference. One-handers for dual wielders are judged in the hand where they gain the most.
- **Other spec (Dual Specialization):** an extra line when an item upgrades the spec you're not in.
- **Context warnings:** cap breaks, set bonus loss, meta deactivation, missing enchants, off-hand requirements and more.
- **Shift-only mode:** show verdicts only while holding **Shift**.

### 🎒 Bag, Loot, Quest & Profession Overlays

Turn the bag and loot arrows and the loot alerts on or off in **Protocol → Interface Options**.

- **Bag upgrade arrows** (**on** by default): green and red arrows on bag items. Works with Blizzard bags, **Bagnon**, **ElvUI**, **GudaBags**, **DaylightUI** (bags and bank, WoW Forever) and **XLoot**. Baganator: the arrow is a **Sharpie's Gear Judge** widget in Baganator's *Icons* tab, and SGJ can also be picked under *Upgrade detection* for the `upgrade` search.
- **Fast bag arrows** (on when bag arrows are enabled): quick single-slot scoring, with a full check for set pieces and weapons.
- **Loot roll arrows** (**off** by default): highlights the best upgrade on group loot popups.
- **Loot upgrade alerts** (**on** by default): when an item you loot or receive is an upgrade, a small alert shows it with the gain. Click it to equip (out of combat), right-click to close.
- **Quest reward overlays:** marks the best choice among quest rewards, in the game's quest window and in **DaylightUI**'s NPC window (WoW Forever).
- **Profession arrows** (always on): recipes that craft an upgrade for you get a green arrow, in Forever's professions window (**DaylightUI**'s too) and in the Classic profession and Enchanting windows (Era, TBC).

### 🧾 The Gear Receipt

Your equipped gear at a glance (`/sgj` → **Receipt**).

- **Left:** your profile, total score and alerts ("2 missing enchants", "1 better item in your bags"). Click an alert to flash the slots it refers to.
- **Middle:** your character with each slot's score beside it. Click a slot for its score breakdown.
- **Right:** your weighted stat totals.

### ⚔️ Weapon Thunderdome (built-in)

A core `/sgj` tab: compare six weapon setups (two-hander, one-hand + off-hand, dual wield) side by side without equipping anything, with the winner and a ranking of every setup. This is **not** the full Laboratory paperdoll.

### 📐 Stat Logic

Your active profile, your cap rings (hit, defense and the like, picked for your role) and every stat weight. Hover a bar for the explanation and the math behind it.

### 🔬 The Laboratory Plugin

*(Separate addon: **SharpiesGearJudge_Laboratory**)*

- Build and compare full gear sets without owning the items: drag items from chat or bags onto a virtual paperdoll.

### 🗺️ The Roadmap Plugin

*(Separate addon: **SharpiesGearJudge_Roadmap**)*

- Ranks zones and dungeons by the upgrades they hold for your character.
- **Content Phase** dropdown (TBC progression) sets which projected gems are available. Without Roadmap, the phase setting exists but has no in-core UI.

### 📋 The Roster Plugin

*(Separate addon: **SharpiesGearJudge_Roster**)*

- **Alt upgrades on tooltips:** hover a tradeable item to see which of your other characters it upgrades, and by how much.
- **Roster grid:** a tab with one column per character and each slot's item and score, so you can see who needs gear most.
- **BoE Finder:** lists the tradeable items your characters hold (bags, bank and mail) that upgrade another of your characters, and who to send them to.

### 🌳 The Talents Plugin

*(Separate addon: **SharpiesGearJudge_Talents** — WoW: Forever only)*

- Talent build guide from level 10 to 60: the next talent glows in the talent window, a side panel shows your progress, and off-build points are flagged.
- Builds for every class, sorted by **Max Level**, **Leveling** (Solo / Dungeon) or **Farming** and by role.
- Gear Judge's weights follow the chosen build: its leveling profile while you level, its level-60 profile at 60.
- **Browse every build online:** [Forever Class Builds](https://sharpiesgearjudge.web.app) lists each class's builds with their talent order by level and the leveling stat weights Gear Judge uses. It's updated as builds change, so it can be a little ahead of the latest release.

### 📈 The XP Plugin

*(Separate addon: **SharpiesGearJudge_XP**)*

- Experience bar with rested XP and quest turn-in projection, upgrades waiting in your bags, a level-up gear alert and a warning before your leveling weights change.

### 👥 Off-Specs & Dual Specialization

- **Off-specs:** tick the profiles a character also plays in **Protocol → Off-Specs** (saved per character), and tooltips show an *(off-spec)* upgrade line for each.
- Off-spec upgrades are judged against the **best gear you own** for that profile: what you wear, your bags, and your bank as seen on your last visit. A Feral Druid sees whether a healing drop beats the healing set in the bank, not the cat gear it's wearing.
- Leveling profiles follow your level, and each profile is scored with the talents you last played it with.
- **Dual Specialization (WoW Forever, Season of Discovery, TBC Anniversary):** each spec keeps its own scoring profile (and Gear for PvP on Forever).

## ⚙️ Settings Guide (Protocol)

Open **Protocol** from the Gear Judge window or with `/sgj config`.

### Interface Options

- **Hide Minimap Button** — Remove the minimap icon.
- **Hide Tooltip Verdict** — Disable SGJ lines on item tooltips.
- **Show Only via Shift Key** — Verdicts appear only while holding Shift.
- **Mute Error Sounds** — Stop the error sound when clicking invalid items.
- **Disable Conflict Check** — Stop the chat warning about Pawn/Zygor.
- **Show Bag Upgrade Arrows** — **On by default.** Green/red arrows on bag items.
- **Fast Bag Arrows** — On by default; only applies when bag arrows are enabled.
- **Show Loot Roll Arrows** — **Off by default.** Arrows on group loot frames.
- **Show Loot Upgrade Alerts** — **On by default.** An alert when an item you loot or receive is an upgrade.

### Tooltip Visuals

- **Compact Equip Text** · **Shorten Stat Names** · **Colorize Stats**

### Comparison Logic

- **Enchant Mode** — Off (Raw Stats) / Current Only / Project Best.
- **Gemming Logic** (TBC) — The Skeptic / The Casual / The Pro.
- **Gem Quality** (TBC) — Common / Uncommon / Rare / Epic tier used when projecting empty sockets.
- **Shield Tanks: No Two-Handers** — On by default. With a shield tank profile, two-handers are never shown as upgrades.

### Buff Assumptions (all versions)

Gear is always judged without the buffs you happen to have on. These add the ones you'd have in a group or raid.

- **Assume Raid Buffed** with a **Raid Buff Preset** — Off / Full Raid / 5-Player Group (Era, Forever) or Off / 25-Man Full / 10-Man Minimal (TBC).
- **Assume World Buffed** with a **World Buff Preset** — Off / Full World Buffed / DM Tribute Only.
- **Assume Consumables** — Assume temporary weapon buffs like Sharpening Stones or Weightstones.
- **Gear for Raiding** (WoW Forever, on by default) — From level 50, value hit and tank defense toward raid caps. Turn off if you won't raid. Greyed out while Gear for PvP is on.
- **Gear for PvP** (WoW Forever, off by default) — Score gear for fighting other players. Saved for each spec.
- **Show Other Spec on Tooltips** — With Dual Specialization, also show upgrades for your other spec.

Your own racials are always applied.

### Character Profile

- **Active Scoring Profile** — **Auto-Detect** picks a profile from your talents. It does not pick imported Pawn profiles. Hybrid builds may show an "uncertain" note in Stat Logic, so pick one by hand if needed.
- **Delete Custom Profile** — Remove a profile you imported.

### Off-Specs

- Tick the profiles this character also plays. Tooltips show an upgrade line for each, judged against the best gear you own for it (worn, bags, bank).

---

## 📥 Importing Custom Weights

Import **Pawn strings** (from SimC or WowSims) or **Sixty Upgrades** exports:

1. Copy your Pawn string or Sixty Upgrades export.
2. Type `/sgj import` in game (or use **Import Pawn String** in Protocol).
3. Paste and confirm. SGJ creates a custom profile you can select in Protocol.

---

## 📥 Installation & Compatibility

One download for every client. SGJ detects which game you're running:

| Client                      | Support                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Classic Era (1.15.x)**    | Hit %, Defense skill, T0–T3 sets, vanilla proc logic                                         |
| **TBC Anniversary (2.5.x)** | Combat ratings, gems, meta gems, TBC sets, progression gem phases                            |
| **WoW: Forever**            | Sim-built weights, level-by-level leveling weights, PvP weights, relics and class combinations |

### Install

Install with the CurseForge app, or extract the `SharpiesGearJudge` folder into your game's `Interface/AddOns` folder:

- `_classic_era_/Interface/AddOns` — Classic Era
- `_anniversary_/Interface/AddOns` — TBC Anniversary
- `_forever_/Interface/AddOns` — WoW: Forever

### Optional plugins

- **SharpiesGearJudge_Laboratory** — Virtual paperdoll / loadout testing.
- **SharpiesGearJudge_Roadmap** — Zone and dungeon loot rankings, and Content Phase control.
- **SharpiesGearJudge_Roster** — Alt upgrades on tooltips, a grid of every character's gear scores, and the BoE Finder.
- **SharpiesGearJudge_Talents** — Talent build guide for WoW: Forever, linked to Gear Judge's weights.
- **SharpiesGearJudge_XP** — Gear-aware experience bar.

### Supported bag addons

Blizzard default bags, **Bagnon**, **ElvUI Bags**, **Baganator**, **GudaBags**, **DaylightUI Bags**, **XLoot** (loot rolls).

### Localization

English, plus German (**deDE**), Spanish (**esES**, **esMX**), French (**frFR**), Brazilian Portuguese (**ptBR**), Russian (**ruRU**), Korean (**koKR**) and Traditional Chinese (**zhTW**). In Korean and Traditional Chinese the interface is translated, but some profile names and TBC gem and enchant names still show in English.

---

## 🏗️ How It Works (Brief)

```
Item tooltip / bag link
    → Parsers/Parse.lua (scan stats, procs, sockets, set headers)
    → Helpers.lua (raw stats, ProcDB, gem/enchant projection)
    → Evaluator.lua (character score, upgrade delta, cap guardian)
    → Judge.lua / Interface.lua (draw tooltip verdict or bag arrow)
```

Set bonuses, meta requirements, weapon specialization, and raid-buff-adjusted caps are applied in the scoring engine — not as flat per-stat multipliers on individual items.
