#Sharpie's Gear Judge (v2.0.1 - TBC Edition)
##The Final Verdict on your Gear for Burning Crusade Classic

* **Supported Versions: World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade Classic (2.5.4+)

* **Sharpie's Gear Judge takes the guesswork out of loot. It doesn't just look at one item; it looks at your entire loadout, your class, your spec, and your exact level to render a final verdict: UPGRADE or DOWNGRADE.
* **Now fully upgraded for The Burning Crusade, featuring intelligent Gem and Enchant projection systems.

##✨ New TBC Features

###💎 The Gem Projection Engine
* **Stop guessing if a socketed item is better. The Judge can now "virtually" socket items to show their true potential.
* **Match Colors Mode: Simulates filling sockets with high-quality gems to activate the Socket Bonus.
* **Stacking Mode: Simulates ignoring colors to stack your best stat (e.g., putting 3 Red Strength gems in a Blue socket chest).
* **Smart Tiers: Projects Green gems for leveling players (1-69) and Rare gems for max-level players (70).

###🔮 Enchant Simulator
* **Current Mode: Compares items exactly as they are (WYSIWYG).
* **Potential Mode: Simulates the Best-in-Slot enchant on the new item to see if it beats your current gear.
* **Budget Awareness: Automatically suggests cheap Classic enchants (e.g., +7 Agility) for leveling gear, and expensive TBC enchants (e.g., Mongoose) for endgame gear.

###🧠 TBC Stat Support
* **The addon now natively reads and weighs all Burning Crusade stats:
* **Combat Ratings: Hit Rating, Crit Rating, Haste Rating, Resilience.
* **New Mechanics: Expertise, Armor Penetration, and Feral Attack Power.
* **True Crit Logic: Uses the TBC scaling matrix to calculate exactly how much % Crit you gain from Agility or Intellect at your specific level.

###🎨 Visual "Gains & Losses"
* **Comparison Mode: When hovering over loot, stats are now sorted into Green (Gains) and Red (Losses) sections, making trade-offs instantly visible.
* **Active State: Stats on your currently equipped items are now highlighted in Gold, clearly separating them from comparison math.

###🛠️ Smart Text Parsing
* **Set Bonus Intelligence: The Judge is now color-aware! It strictly ignores Gray (inactive) set bonuses to prevent false upgrades, while correctly counting Green (active) set bonuses.
* **Racial Synergy: If an item activates your racial skill (e.g., Human + Sword, Orc + Axe), a special line Matches Racial: +5 Expertise will appear in the tooltip to show the hidden bonus.

###⚙️ Core Features
* **Dynamic Leveling Matrix (1-70)
* **The addon evolves with you as you grow:
* **Levels 1-20: Scores items based on Survival & Regeneration.
* **Levels 21-57: Shifts focus to Raw Power & Talents.
* **Levels 58-69 (Outland): Prioritizes Stamina & Questing Speed.
* **Level 70 (Endgame): Switches to strict Raiding Weights (Hit Cap, Crit, Haste).

###🔬The Judge's Lab
* **Type /sgj to open the visual Drag-and-Drop laboratory.
* **Test hypothetical loadouts by dragging items from AtlasLoot, the Dungeon Journal, or chat links into the slots to compare against your current gear.

###⚡Lightning Fast UI
* **RatingBuster Style: Clean, yellow text aligned to the right of the tooltip.
* **Conflict Manager: Automatically detects other addons (RestedXP, Pawn, Zygor) and offers to disable their conflicting tooltips.
