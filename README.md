# Sharpie's Gear Judge (v1.6.2)
**The Final Verdict on your Gear for WoW Classic Era**

Sharpie's Gear Judge takes the guesswork out of loot. It doesn't just look at one item; it looks at your entire loadout, your class, your spec, **your talents**, and **your exact level** to render a final verdict: **UPGRADE** or **DOWNGRADE**.

# 🧠 The Dynamic Engine
The Judge now thinks like a player. It calculates stat weights in **Real-Time** every time you hover over an item:
* **🚫 Hit Cap Awareness:** If you reach the Hit Cap (e.g., 9% for Melee), the addon instantly detects it and devalues Hit Rating on the next tooltip. No more wasted stats.
* **⚡ Talent Scaling:** The addon reads your Talent Tree. If you have **Divine Strength** (+10% Str) or **Heart of the Wild** (+20% Int), the addon automatically increases the score of items with those stats.
* **📉 Diminishing Returns:** Automatically adjusts weights as you approach caps, ensuring you never "overpay" for a stat you don't need.

# ⚖️ Key Features

### The Verdict Tooltip ⚔️ Context-Aware Scoring
Hover over any item to see an instant, intelligent comparison against your equipped gear.
* **Enchant Projection:** Toggle the ability to "virtually" move your current enchant onto new loot to see its true potential power.
* **Racial Synergy:** Automatically factors in racial weapon specializations (e.g., Humans with Swords/Maces, Orcs with Axes).
* **Speed Optimization:** Values weapon speeds correctly for your class (e.g., favoring slow Main Hands for Warriors and Rogues).
* **Smart Pairing:** If you compare a 2-Hander while dual-wielding, it automatically finds the best combination in your bags to calculate the *net* gain/loss.
* **Weapon Proficiency:** Knows your class! Won't tell a Priest to equip a Sword.

### 📈 Dynamic Leveling Matrix
The addon evolves with you as you grow:
* **Levels 1-20:** Scores items based on **Survival & Regeneration**.
* **Levels 21-40:** Shifts focus to **Raw Power & Talents**.
* **Levels 41-59:** Prioritizes **Hit, Crit, & Pre-Raid Stats**.
* **Dungeon Smart:** If you are spec'd as a Tank or Healer, the addon automatically switches to "Dungeon Mode" weights so you can gear for your role, not just for solo questing.
* **Auto-Spec Detection:** Detects your talent build to apply accurate stat weights (Holy, Protection, Retribution, etc.).

### 🧾The Gear Receipt - feedback or ideas msg me on discord >>links on page<<
Type `/sgjreceipt` (or click the button in options) to open your **Character Audit**.
* **Full Loadout Scan:** See a clean, zebra-striped list of every equipped item and its contribution to your power.
* **Combined Stats:** A dynamic summary box that adds up *all* your gear's stats.
* **Smart Filtering:** Automatically hides useless stats (e.g., hides Strength for Mages) and highlights your most important attributes in **Green**.

### 🧪 The Judge's Lab (`/sgj`)
A custom visual interface for advanced theorycrafting.
* **⚔️ 2H vs. Dual Wield Logic:** The Lab automatically handles complex comparisons. If you drag a 2-Handed Staff into the slot, it compares it against the combined score of your currently equipped Main Hand + Off Hand.
* **🔎 Smart Gap Filling:** If you only drag in a Main Hand weapon (e.g., a Sword) but you are currently dual-wielding, the Judge automatically assumes you will keep your current Off-Hand to give you a fair comparison.
* **📊 Stat Breakdown:** Just like the tooltip, the Lab provides a detailed breakdown of exactly which stats you gain or lose in this hypothetical scenario (e.g., +14 Strength, -0.5% Crit).
* **🎨 Class-Themed UI:** The window dynamically loads your class crest (Warrior, Paladin, etc.) for a customized look.

### ⚙️ Configuration
* **Strict Mode:** Compare items exactly as they drop.
* **Potential Mode:** Compare items as if they were fully enchanted.
* **Profile:** Auto-detects your spec/level, or force specific modes (e.g., "Tank", "PvP") manually via the settings menu.
* **ElvUI Support:** Integrated skinning support that matches your UI while preserving custom high-visibility slot borders.

### ⚡ Lightning Fast UI
* **Clean, colored text** aligned for easy information.
* **Derived Stats:** Shows the *real* value of stats (e.g., converts "10 Intellect" into "150 Mana + 0.16% Crit").
* **Conflict Manager:** Automatically detects other addons (RestedXP, Pawn, Zygor) and offers to disable their conflicting tooltips.
* **Class Branded:** Features high-quality, class-specific background crests for a premium feel.
