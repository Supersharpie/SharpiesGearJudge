# Sharpie's Gear Judge

**"The Final Verdict on Your Gear."**

**Sharpie's Gear Judge** is a professional-grade theorycrafting and stat comparison tool for World of Warcraft: Classic Era. It goes beyond simple tooltip numbers by analyzing your talent spec, racial bonuses, weapon speeds, and current enchants to tell you if an item is *actually* an upgrade for your specific character.

## ⚖️ Key Features

### The Verdict Tooltip
Hover over any item to see an instant, intelligent comparison against your equipped gear.
* **Enchant Projection:** Toggle the ability to "virtually" move your current enchant onto new loot to see its true potential power.
* **Racial Synergy:** Automatically factors in racial weapon specializations (e.g., Humans with Swords/Maces, Orcs with Axes).
* **Speed Optimization:** Values weapon speeds correctly for your class (e.g., favoring slow Main Hands for Warriors and Rogues).
* **Smart Pairing:** If you compare a 2-Hander while dual-wielding, it automatically finds the best combination in your bags to calculate the *net* gain/loss.

### 🧪 The Judge's Lab (`/sgj`)
A custom visual interface for advanced theorycrafting.
* **Drag & Drop:** Simulate gear sets by dragging items from your bags or loot windows directly into the Lab slots.
* **3-Way Comparison:** Compare a Main Hand + Off Hand pair directly against a Two-Hander.
* **Class Branded:** Features high-quality, class-specific background crests for a premium feel.

### ⚙️ Smart Logic
* **Auto-Spec Detection:** Detects your talent build to apply accurate stat weights (Holy, Protection, Retribution, etc.).
* **ElvUI Support:** Integrated skinning support that matches your UI while preserving custom high-visibility slot borders.
