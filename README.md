# Sharpie's Gear Judge (v2.0.0 - TBC Edition)
**The Final Verdict on your Gear for Burning Crusade Classic**

Sharpie's Gear Judge takes the guesswork out of loot. It doesn't just look at one item; it looks at your entire loadout, your class, your spec, and **your exact level** to render a final verdict: **UPGRADE** or **DOWNGRADE**.

Now fully upgraded for **The Burning Crusade**, featuring intelligent Gem and Enchant projection systems.

## ✨ New TBC Features

### 💎 The Gem Projection Engine
Stop guessing if a socketed item is better. The Judge can now "virtually" socket items to show their true potential.
* **Match Colors Mode:** Simulates filling sockets with high-quality gems to activate the **Socket Bonus**.
* **Stacking Mode:** Simulates ignoring colors to stack your best stat (e.g., putting 3 Red Strength gems in a Blue socket chest).
* **Smart Tiers:** Projects **Green gems** for leveling players (1-69) and **Rare gems** for max-level players (70).

### 🔮 Enchant Simulator
* **Current Mode:** Compares items exactly as they are (WYSIWYG).
* **Potential Mode:** Simulates the **Best-in-Slot enchant** on the new item to see if it beats your current gear.
* **Budget Awareness:** Automatically suggests cheap Classic enchants (e.g., +7 Agility) for leveling gear, and expensive TBC enchants (e.g., Mongoose) for endgame gear.

### 🧠 TBC Stat Support
The addon now natively reads and weighs all Burning Crusade stats:
* **Combat Ratings:** Hit Rating, Crit Rating, Haste Rating, Resilience.
* **New Mechanics:** Expertise, Armor Penetration, and Feral Attack Power.
* **Stat Conversion:** Hover over "20 Expertise Rating" to see exactly how much Dodge% it removes from the boss.

## ⚔️ Core Features

### Dynamic Leveling Matrix (1-70)
The addon evolves with you as you grow:
* **Levels 1-20:** Scores items based on **Survival & Regeneration**.
* **Levels 21-57:** Shifts focus to **Raw Power & Talents**.
* **Levels 58-69 (Outland):** Prioritizes **Stamina & Questing Speed**.
* **Level 70 (Endgame):** Switches to strict **Raiding Weights** (Hit Cap, Crit, Haste).

### The Judge's Lab
* Type `/sgj` to open the visual Drag-and-Drop laboratory.
* Test hypothetical loadouts by dragging items from AtlasLoot, the Dungeon Journal, or chat links into the slots to compare against your current gear.

### Lightning Fast UI
* **RatingBuster Style:** Clean, yellow text aligned to the right of the tooltip.
* **Conflict Manager:** Automatically detects other addons (RestedXP, Pawn, Zygor) and offers to disable their conflicting tooltips.
