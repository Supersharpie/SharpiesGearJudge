# Sharpie's Gear Judge (v1.3.1)
**The Final Verdict on your Gear for WoW Classic Era (Phase 6)**

Sharpie's Gear Judge takes the guesswork out of loot. It doesn't just look at one item; it looks at your entire loadout, your class, your spec, and your level to render a final verdict: **UPGRADE** or **DOWNGRADE**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Smart Scoring Engine
* **Context Aware:** Compares 2-Handed weapons against your Main Hand + Off Hand combo automatically.
* **Smart Leveling:** Automatically detects if you are leveling (1-59) and prioritizes **Stamina & Efficiency**. Once you hit 60, it seamlessly switches to **Raid Weights** (Hit Cap, Crit, Spell Power).
* **Racial Synergy:** Knows your race! Humans get points for Swords/Maces, Orcs for Axes, etc.
* **Weapon Proficiency:** Knows your class! Won't tell a Priest to equip a Sword.

### 🔮 Enchant Projection (Potential Mode)
* Don't be fooled by raw stats. "Potential Mode" simulates what an item *would* look like if you enchanted it with your current enchant.
* Supports complex Phase 6 enchants (ZG Idols, Naxx Shoulder Enchants).

### ⚖️ The Judge's Lab
* Type `/sgj` to open the visual Drag-and-Drop laboratory.
* Test hypothetical loadouts by dragging items from the shop, dungeon journal, or other players into the slots to compare against your current gear.

### ⚡ Lightning Fast UI
* **RatingBuster Style:** Clean, yellow text aligned to the right.
* **Derived Stats:** Shows the *real* value of stats (e.g., converts "10 Intellect" into "150 Mana + 0.16% Crit").
* **Conflict Manager:** Automatically detects other addons (RestedXP, Pawn, Zygor) and offers to disable their conflicting tooltips so you have a clean experience.

## 🚀 Installation
