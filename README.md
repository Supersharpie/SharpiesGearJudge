# Sharpie's Gear Judge (v1.4.0)
**The Final Verdict on your Gear for WoW Classic Era**

Sharpie's Gear Judge takes the guesswork out of loot. It doesn't just look at one item; it looks at your entire loadout, your class, your spec, and **your exact level** to render a final verdict: **UPGRADE** or **DOWNGRADE**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Dynamic Leveling Matrix (NEW!)
The addon evolves with you as you grow:
* **Levels 1-20:** Scores items based on **Survival & Regeneration**.
* **Levels 21-40:** Shifts focus to **Raw Power & Talents**.
* **Levels 41-59:** Prioritizes **Hit, Crit, & Pre-Raid Stats**.
* **Dungeon Smart:** If you are spec'd as a Tank or Healer, the addon automatically switches to "Dungeon Mode" weights so you can gear for your role, not just for solo questing.

### ⚔️ Context-Aware Scoring
* **Smart Comparisons:** Automatically compares 2-Handed weapons against your Main Hand + Off Hand combo.
* **Racial Synergy:** Knows your race! Humans get points for Swords/Maces, Orcs for Axes, etc.
* **Weapon Proficiency:** Knows your class! Won't tell a Priest to equip a Sword.
* **Legacy Stats:** Fully supports "Classic Era" phrasing like `Increased Daggers +5` or `Restores 4 mana per 5 sec`.

### ⚖️ The Judge's Lab
* Type `/sgj` to open the visual Drag-and-Drop laboratory.
* Test hypothetical loadouts by dragging items from the shop, dungeon journal, or other players into the slots to compare against your current gear.

### ⚡ Lightning Fast UI
* **RatingBuster Style:** Clean, yellow text aligned to the right.
* **Derived Stats:** Shows the *real* value of stats (e.g., converts "10 Intellect" into "150 Mana + 0.16% Crit").
* **Conflict Manager:** Automatically detects other addons (RestedXP, Pawn, Zygor) and offers to disable their conflicting tooltips.

## 🚀 Installation
1.  Extract the `SharpiesGearJudge` folder into your WoW AddOns directory:
    * `_classic_era_\Interface\AddOns\`
2.  Launch WoW Classic.

## 🎮 Commands
* `/sgj` or `/judge` - Open "The Judge's Lab" (Visual Comparison).

* **Minimap Button:**
    * **Left-Click:** Toggle Judge's Lab.
    * **Right-Click:** Open Settings.

## ⚙️ Configuration
* **Strict Mode:** Compare items exactly as they drop.
* **Potential Mode:** Compare items as if they were fully enchanted.
* **Profile:** Auto-detects your spec/level, or force specific modes (e.g., "Tank", "PvP") manually via the settings menu.
