# Sharpie's Gear Judge - Version History

## v2.1.0 - The "Anniversary" Update (Core + Plugins)
**Major Architecture Overhaul & TBC Phase 5 Readiness**

### 🏗️ The "Core + Plugin" Architecture
* **Modular Class Design:** The addon has been completely restructured. The massive `Database.lua` has been split into individual Class Modules (`Classes/Warrior.lua`, `Classes/Mage.lua`, etc.).
* **Memory Efficiency:** The addon now only loads the math logic for *your* specific class, significantly reducing memory usage.
* **Extensibility:** This structure allows for easier updates to specific classes without breaking the entire addon.

### ⚔️ TBC Phase 1–5 Complete
* **Sunwell Ready:** Added support for Phase 5 items, including **Shattered Sun Pendants**, **Sunwell Badge Gear**, and the new **Epic Gems**.
* **Trinket Overrides:** Added manual proc valuations for over 100+ TBC trinkets (e.g., *Dragonspine Trophy*, *Shard of Contempt*, *Blackened Naaru Sliver*). "Use" and "Proc" effects are now converted into passive stat averages for scoring.
* **Relic Support:** Added specific stat mappings for **Idols, Librams, and Totems**. Items like *Idol of the Raven Goddess* or *Totem of the Void* now display correct scores instead of "0".

### 🧠 Math 2.0: "Smart Scaling"
* **Covariance Logic:** The Judge now understands synergy.
    * *Example:* If your Attack Power is high, the value of Crit Rating automatically increases.
    * *Example:* If your Spell Power is high, the value of Haste Rating increases.
* **Hysteresis (Anti-Loop):** Fixed the "Equip/Unequip" loop bug. The addon now uses a "Buffer Zone" (15 rating) before telling you to drop Hit/Defense below the cap, ensuring you don't accidentally uncap yourself.
* **Poison Protection:** Added a safety net (0.02 weight) to off-stats (e.g., Strength on a Mage item) to prevent them from showing a negative score due to internal penalties.

### 🛡️ Spec-Specific Logic
* **Warrior:** Added "Anti-Dual Wield" logic for Arms. The addon now explicitly sets Offhand DPS value to zero for Arms Warriors to enforce 2H dominance.
* **Druid:** Fixed parsing for **"Feral Attack Power"**. The Judge now correctly distinguishes between generic AP and the massive Feral AP found on staves.
* **Paladin/Shaman:** Added racial checks for Weapon Expertise (Human/Orc) and Hit (Draenei).
* **Hunter:** Fixed Hit Cap logic to use **Ranged Hit** instead of Melee Hit.

### 📜 UI & Tooltips
* **The Ledger:** The "Receipt" window has been polished to show a cleaner breakdown of Active Stats vs. Capped Stats.
* **Gem Projection:** Fixed a bug where the "Smart Gem" auditor would sometimes suggest Unique gems you already had equipped.
